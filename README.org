* About

This configuration is meant to be a good starting point for people new to Emacs, a
single file (plus the early-init.file).

It comes with completion and an lsp-client which you will have to enable for
your choice of languages.

I've added some custom functionality and keybinds that I personally like but
mainly they serve as examples on how to do certain things *and you are encouraged to
delete anything you don't want.*

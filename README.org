* About

This configuration is meant to be a good starting point for people new to Emacs, a
single file (plus the early-init.file).

It comes with completion and an lsp-client which you will have to enable for
your choice of languages.

I've added some custom functionality and keybinds that I personally like but
mainly it serves as examples on how to do things *and you are encouraged to
delete anything you don't want.*

Here's a community driven list of useful Emacs packages, utilities and libraries
that you might want to check out.
